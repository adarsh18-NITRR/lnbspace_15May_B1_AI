How accurate were you? How long did it take? This task, called
the Stroop Test, is much more challenging than it first appears.
It's much harder to identify a color when it's different from the
word than it is to identify when the two match. This challenging
test relies on two key cognitive skills, response inhibition and
selective attention.

Brief history of the Stroop Test
--------------------------------

In 1935, a farmer's son named John Ridley Stroop became the
first to publish in English on the current version of this
cognitive task. Developed as part of his dissertation at George
Peabody College, his task became the basis for the Stroop Test,
which remains a widely used neuropsychological assessment to this
day.

How your brain processes the Stroop Test
----------------------------------------

Because most people=E2=80=99s automatic response is to read a word, the
Stroop Test is a classic test of response inhibition. This skill
involves responding quickly while avoiding incorrect impulses
that may interfere with accomplishing goal-driven tasks. Response
inhibition is associated with the brain=E2=80=99s executive function, and
brain imaging studies have found that that performing the Stroop
Test activates brain areas involved in executive function, such
as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

The Stroop Test also challenges selective attention, or the
ability to choose which stimuli to focus on and which to ignore.
The mental flexibility required to switch between multiple
stimuli is essential: without good selective attention, it can
also be easy to make errors.

Try a version of Stroop's test for yourself
-------------------------------------------

Stroop's test has long outlived him. Cited thousands of times,
his original paper is one of the most famous studies in
experimental psychology. Versions of his test continue to be used
in research =E2=80=94 and you can try a version for yourself by playing

From lab to laptop: The origins of Lumosity games
-------------------------------------------------

For decades, researchers have created tasks that measure
cognitive abilities. Traditionally, these are often administered
during in-person studies using pen and paper =E2=80=94 which means they
rarely get far from the lab.

That=E2=80=99s where we come in. Our scientists and game designers work
together to turn common cognitive and neuropsychological research
tasks into fun, exciting games =E2=80=94 bringing cognitive research to
70 million people worldwide.

From cognitive task to engaging game
------------------------------------

When creating a new game, our in-house scientists first identify
a cognitive ability, such as working memory or divided attention.
They then find a way to challenge that skill. They=E2=80=99ll either
adapt cognitive or neuropsychological tasks used by researchers
for decades to test cognition, or they=E2=80=99ll use their knowledge and
research experience to design entirely new, experimental
challenges.

Working with experienced game designers, our scientists transform
these tasks into over 50 beautiful, challenging, and fun games
that anyone can access from a computer or mobile device. Many of
our games adapt to a player=E2=80=99s ability level, ensuring that each
person is challenged to the full extent of their abilities.

The origins of popular Lumosity games
-------------------------------------

Let=E2=80=99s examine the roots of some popular Lumosity games. The
much-loved Color Match is inspired by the Stroop Task, which was
first published in English in 1935 as a way to assess impulse
control. Since that time, the Stroop Task has been cited in over
2000 psychological studies and adapted by many researchers.

Or how about Lost in Migration, which you may have played to
challenge your selective attention? It=E2=80=99s based on the Flanker
Task, which was designed to help researchers investigate
selective attention.

More than games: creating a personal trainer
--------------------------------------------

Modeled from the concept of a physical personal trainer,
Lumosity gives you a wide variety of games that challenge many
abilities, such as Memory and Attention. Game difficulty adapts
to you =E2=80=94 pushing you to operate at the limits of your abilities
and stay challenged.

As we learn more about the possibilities of brain training, we
invite you to keep training, and join us in our mission to
advance the understanding of human cognition.

p;‌Before we get into tips wh=
ile cutting your own hair, let's not forget that barbers and stylists have =
been heavily affected by COVID-19. We've taken the initiative to create a <=

Barber Relief Fund, that will donate 15% of your order amount to=

ODAYBefore you cut y=
our own hairOne thing to remember &nda=
sh;you can always cut more.So, start off small and work your confidence up. If you go and t=
ake a chunk off, you'll have to make it even. Consider cutting on the =
side you're least comfortable with.If you're right-handed, start trimming the left side of you=
r head. The reason being; if you do a good job on the side you're least com=
fortable with, that will be your guide – and eventually the side you'=
ll be matching for the rest of the trimming time.Take it slow.Cut off small pieces at a time, all while making sure you're matched on =
both sides.Don't try to do it quic=
k, andalways take your time.Lastly, remember that y=
ou're not at a barbershop, and that it's ok if it's not perfect.30 DAY SATISFACTION GUARANTEECopyright © 2020 BluMaan, All rights r=

Hello! How are you doing today?

As an essential service provider, Zomato is taking extra care to ensure tha=
t the food we provide you has gone through multiple safety checks before it=
 reaches your doorstep. Here are the 8 things we are doing for safe food de=
liveries=F0=9F=91=87

https://bnc.lt/WJml/rOHkAFcHt6

All our restaurant partners sanitize their kitchens every few hours.

https://bnc.lt/WJml/rOHkAFcHt6

It is compulsory for restaurant staff to use protective masks in kitchens.

https://bnc.lt/WJml/rOHkAFcHt6

Staff is allowed to work only if their body temperature is below 99=C2=B0F

https://bnc.lt/WJml/rOHkAFcHt6

Just like restaurant staff, our delivery partners go through daily temperat=
ure checks.

https://bnc.lt/WJml/rOHkAFcHt6

While on duty, all our delivery partners wear masks.

https://bnc.lt/WJml/rOHkAFcHt6

Before picking up every order, our delivery partners wash/sanitize their ha=
nds.

https://bnc.lt/WJml/rOHkAFcHt6

Contact Tracing of delivery partners is done using Aarogya Setu (by Govt. o=
f India).

https://bnc.lt/WJml/rOHkAFcHt6

Contactless Delivery helps our riders maintain social distancing with you.

With our 8 MAX Safety Measures, your order is safe at every step. Stay home=
, stay strong, you can count on us if you need food!

View restaurants https://bnc.lt/WJml/PSLiIsQHt6

Please note that very rarely, one or more safety features may not be availa=
ble due to physical constraints.

Hey, you!

It=E2=80=99s me, your favourite Biryani. I know we have grown (just a littl=
e) apart in these testing times. But no worries, I am here to assure you th=
at our love is safe, even more so with Zomato=E2=80=99s 8 MAX Safety Measur=
es in place.

Allow me to take you through my journey from the restaurant kitchen to your=
 doorstep!

https://bnc.lt/WJml/wg35qJdXJ6

First, I am prepared in a well-sanitised kitchen by staff wearing protectiv=
e masks, after having their temperature checked.

https://bnc.lt/WJml/wg35qJdXJ6

I am then passed on to a delivery partner who wears a clean mask, gets the =
temperature check done and washes hands before order pick-up.

https://bnc.lt/WJml/wg35qJdXJ6

My delivery partner and I zip through the city while taking extra care usin=
g the Aarogya Setu App.=E2=80=8B

https://bnc.lt/WJml/wg35qJdXJ6

Finally, I am left outside the door on a clean surface if you opt-in for Co=
ntactless Delivery.

So as you can see, Zomato=E2=80=99s restaurant and delivery partners are ma=
king sure that you and I end up together, with a layer of safety to complim=
ent us perfectly. I=E2=80=99d be waiting for you on the Zomato app, have me=
 over whenever you miss me.

I want to order! https://bnc.lt/WJml/tBfNvS8WJ6

 India. It is a privilege to write to you against the backdrop of the Inter=
national Day of Yoga (IDY) -2020, which is just a few days away.=20=20=20Many of our fellow-citizens have been asking this qu=
estion of late: I want to be a part of IDY -2020; but what should I do for =
it? This message tries to clarify the position.=20=20=20Yoga is an invaluable ancient Indian practice with n=
umerous benefits to both physical and mental health. Given the context of t=
he current COVID-19 pandemic including restrictions on the movement of peop=
le and a slowdown in economic activity, the benefits offered by Yoga have b=
ecome especially important for physical and mental wellbeing. Of particular=
 importance are its proven benefits on general health and immunity enhancem=
ent, along with its globally accepted role as a stress buster.=20=20The mass performance of the Common Yoga Protocol (C=
YP)-one of the most popular Yoga programmes across the world-will remain at=
 the heart of the International Day of Yoga (IDY) like always, but this yea=
r IDY will be observed in a non-congregative manner. Therefore, you and you=
r family are requested to join thousands of others on this day from your re=
spective homes by doing the 45- minute long CYP drill at 7.00 AM on 21st Ju=
ne 2020. It is designed to be easily adoptable by the majority of the peopl=
e irrespective of age and gender, and can be learnt through simple training=
 sessions, even through online classes (individuals facing health issues ar=
e advised to consult a physician before taking up Yoga practice)..=20To make the observation of IDY at home possible, th=
e Ministry of AYUSH and other stakeholders have been running multiple train=
ing programmes on Yoga and CYP. You may follow the Ministry's social media =
handles for additional details. Announcement on specific activities for 21s=
t June 2020 will also be made available on these channels as we approach th=
e IDY. Please use the attached resources in preparing yourself and your fam=
ily for IDY 2020. If you are already trained in CYP, please start teaching =
the same to your family members.=20As June 21st is just a few days away. Prepare yours=
elf and be there to do Yoga with the world. See you at 7.00 AM on 21st June=
 2020.=20Warm regards,PN Ranjit Kumar, Joint Secretar=

Dear Applicant,

Greetings from Symbiosis International (Deemed University) [SIU] !!!

We thank you for your patience as we navigate through turbulent times. We h=
ave
received representations from parents and aspirants regarding the apprehens=
ions
about conducting a computer-based entrance test for the Under Graduate
programmes at SIU.

Further to the representations and owing to the following reasons :
    our concern over the safety of the applicants taking the entrance tests=
 at a
    designated center,
    extension of lockdown in some parts of the country,
    cancellation / postponement of similar All India level public examinati=
ons,
    rising number of coronavirus infected cases in the country,=20
    prevailing uncertainty over the direction the pandemic may take,
    loss of time for the delivery of academic sessions and
    career and aspirations of our candidates and students,=20
SIU has decided not to conduct SET B / SLAT / SITEEE in a computer-based te=
st
mode at test centres.=20
One of the strongest and most viable alternatives is reverting to an
internet-based, proctored test mode which an applicant can take from the sa=
fety,
security, and comfort of her/his home. The details regarding the same will =
be
communicated to you at the earliest.
We will also keep you posted on further developments and infrastructure
requirements through mails sent to your registered email ID and SET portal =
as
soon as these are finalised.

We trust that you will support us in these trying times. This too shall pas=
s and
we look forward to opening up our campuses to our students as soon as feasi=
ble.=20

Stay Safe. Stay Home. All the best!

Warm Regards,

Dear ADARSH SHARMA  ,

This is further to our earlier communication regarding SET-B / SLAT / SITEE=
E /
AIAT not being conducted in a computer-based test mode.

As we revert to an internet-based remote-proctored test, we will guide you
through the process to ensure that you face no difficulties on the day of t=
he
test.

The most critical first step towards being able to successfully appear for =
the
same is the Infrastructure Readiness Check (IRC).

Infrastructure Readiness Check

In this step, ensure that your system and internet bandwidth / speed are as=
 per
the requirement of taking the internet-based remote-proctored test. Details=
 of
the infrastructure requirement and the process to be followed for the IRC a=
re
attached along with this email. These documents can also be viewed on the s=
et
website:

1. Infrastructure Requirement Details (click hereto access the same)

2. IRC Process Document (click hereto access the s=
ame)

Please go through the attached IRC Process Document and below mentioned vid=
eo
link before you take the Infrastructure Readiness Check.

https://youtu.be/irh60fiC850

In case you face any issue during this process, you will have the opportuni=
ty to
communicate the issue to the Technical Helpdesk by raising a ticket via cha=
t.
Once the technical issues are resolved, and the checks are successfully
completed, your system would be ready for the test. You are advised to use =
the
same system and internet connection for all your future processes till the =
SET B
/ SLAT / SITEEE examination is completed.

Please note that your IRC is scheduled from 10 a.m. to 12 noon on 9th July =
2020

The URL for Login and your Login credentials will be shared with you via a
separate communication.

Thank you.

Stay Home. Stay Safe. Stay Healthy.

Subject: Counselling Issue


Dear Sir,

My name is Adarsh Sharma and my rank is 14958 and I got message for  provis=
ional admission today for Mechanical fee category 1.

The allotted branch was my 4th preference and 3rd preference was CS (fee ca=
tegory 2).

In reference to the above I have following queries

Questions-

So if the reject the seat allotted will I move to second phase counselling =
automatically ?

Will I be upgrade from Mechanical to CS if a vacancy is created if somebody=
 leaves the seat in the first semester?

Hope to hear soon.



Also I would like to highlight the fact that all the helpline numbers are u=
navailable which has caused a delay in decision.

Dear Candidates,

Greetings from Symbiosis Institute of Technology!

This is regarding the payment confirmation emails being sent to you
acknowledging the payments made towards the first installment of the admiss=
ion
fees.

=20

Sometimes, the payments processed by you are not settled by the concerned b=
ank
in real time, resulting in these settlements being executed the next day.
Thereafter, the settlement reports are sent to the university via BILLDESK,
followed by the auto acknowledgement emails being sent to your registered e=
mail
IDs.

=20

Hence, sometimes this process takes more time than usual. We request you to=
 keep
calm and be assured of receiving payment acknowledgement emails soon after
executing the said payments.=20

=20

We understand the importance of this acknowledgement and will be happy to
support and assist you in this respect.=20

Yours Sincerely,

Dear Sir,
My name is Adarsh Sharma and my rank is 14958 and I got message for  provis=
ional admission today for Mechanical fee category 1.
The allotted branch was my 4th preference and 3rd preference was CS (fee ca=
tegory 2).
In reference to the above I have following queries
Questions-
So if the reject the seat allotted will I move to second phase counselling =
automatically ?
Will I be upgrade from Mechanical to CS if a vacancy is created if somebody=
 leaves the seat in the first semester?
Hope to hear soon.


Also I would like to highlight the fact that all the helpline numbers are u=
navailable which has caused a delay in decision.
